# 5. Chapter five: Method

There are two concepts to describe the executable code fragments, one is called "function", the other is called "method".

Well the concept of "function" sounds that the result won't change if the arguments don't change. In multi-task environment, it's not quite easy to make that true all the time, so we choose the other concept "method".

- [5. Chapter five: Method](#5-chapter-five-method)
  - [5.1. Method definition](#51-method-definition)
    - [5.1.1. Atomic method](#511-atomic-method)
    - [5.1.2. Parameter definitions](#512-parameter-definitions)
    - [5.1.3. Return prototype](#513-return-prototype)
  - [5.2. Method implementation](#52-method-implementation)

## 5.1. Method definition

Any method callable has to be defined, the formal format of method definition as follow:

~~~ebnf
method definition = "method", [& method definition modifier ], method name, parameter definition list, return prototype ;
method definition modifiers = "public"|"protected"|"private"|"const"|"atomic"|"meta";
method name = ["$"], label;
parameter definition list = "(", parameter definition++",", ")";
~~~

Again, there's no need to suffix a terminator character such as a semicolon to explicitly declare the end of the definition.

Example:

~~~
class File {
    method public close() void
}
~~~

### 5.1.1. Atomic method

The modifier `atomic` is used to declare that this method cannot be interrupted by other process.

### 5.1.2. Parameter definitions

Parameters are elements initialized at the very beginning of the calling by the caller. The formal format as follow:

~~~ebnf
parameter definition = [element type], ["const"], parameter name, [type expression] ["=", expression ];
element type = "obj"|"ptr"|"ref"|"rel";
parameter name = label;
~~~

Example:

~~~
class File {
    method meta public Open( const fileName string ) ref File
}
~~~

You may bundle the default value of the parameter using the operator `=`.

The parameter definition is a kind of element prototype definition, but the some parts are optional.

The element type is optional because sometimes, the compiler can reduct the element type according to the type expression.

As you maybe already noticed that the type expression after the parameter name is optional also. This is because of the concept of `quasi method`, we'll talk about it soon enough.

### 5.1.3. Return prototype

The return value in the Alioth programming language is an element also, so the type of the return value is an element prototype. The formal format as follow:

~~~ebnf
return prototype = [element type], ["const"], [type expression];
~~~

If the compiler can reduct the element type for the return value, you can omitted the element type.

If the type expression is omitted, the method will be compiled as an `quasi method`.

## 5.2. Method implementation

To implement a method, you have to write a syntax structure named `method implementation` at the top scope.

The formal format of the method implementation as follow:

~~~ebnf
method implementation = "method", [& method implementation modifier ], class name, method name, parameter list, return prototype, method body;
method implementation modifier = "const";
class name = name expression;
method name = label;
parameter list = "(", parameter++"," , ")";
parameter = [element type], ["const"], parameter name, [type expression];
method body = "{" statement* "}";
~~~

Not all method definition modifiers are necessary to be written in the method implementation, so the set of the method implementation modifier is different from the method definition modifier set.

The second difference between the definition and the implementation is that the parameter in the implementation cannot be followed by a default value, because this will cause conflict with the parameter definition.
